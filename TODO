<!-- TODO: Luke. 
    //Done: step 1) finish the basic version of rock paper scissors here. Have a button for each option with a little image on each.
            keep track of the score. 
    step 2) carry on with the odin project. We come back to RPS.
    step 3) When you come back to RPS, implement the alternative version. https://medium.com/game-design-fundamentals/rock-paper-scissors-modified-5da9ec3facf5
            You can either replace it or have a button at the top to swap between versions. This should have a segmented bar 
            on the  left and right to represent how many points you and the computer have. You get more for winning etc. 
            It doesn't need to be too fancy, just implement that. You can come back and add more at a later date. 
    step 4) Add more RPS variants. That you can swap between. There could be one where rocks/paper/and scissors fall from 
            the top and you have to type the one that beats it to get rid of it. They speed up as time goes by; standard 
            typing game.
